In 2010 alone, an estimated 60-70 million Americans suffered from a chronic digestive disease such as gastroparesis. The evidence base for the use of electric stimulation to treat diseases like gastroparesis is still very limited. Modulating gastric function is an important target function for electroceutical devices looking to provide therapy. Recording gastric motility in freely behaving animal models will form the needed foundation for neuromodulation protocols that can correct shortcomings in past, first-generation bioelectronic attempts to ameliorate and monitor gastric disorders. We are developing a fully implantable system capable of recording serosal gastric myoelectrical activity using electrogastrography (EGG) as well as stomach contractile activity using strain gauge transducers, in collaboration with researchers at &#xA0;Purdue University and the University of Melbourne. Validation in freely behaving rodent models represents the first instance of continuous measurement of gastrointestinal motility in freely moving animal models. Subsequent validation in pigs represents large animal preclinical proof-of-principle and opens the door to future work investigating the development of closed-loop feedback algorithms and stimulation to modulate gastric function.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Extra-Occular Stimulation to Treat Glaucoma]]></title><link>https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/research/glaucoma/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">63e3ca757644608e41598555</guid><category><![CDATA[Research]]></category><category><![CDATA[Research Topics]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[CID]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 06:23:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2022/08/photo-1615552441070-cbe0d49f5ae9.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Photoactivated Ion Channel Blockers for Heart Attack Treatment]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Acute myocardial infarctions (heart attacks, AMI) occur almost 800,000 times a year in the US.

They result from blockages in the coronary arteries (the blood vessels that feed the heart oxygen) and can be treated with catheters that enter the arteries through the arm or leg and snake their way up, tipped with an inflatable balloon and sometimes a metal stent. The balloon is inflated to compress the material blocking the artery against the walls, introducing a lumen that can be held open with the stent. However, abrupt reintroduction of blood (also known as reperfusion) causes reversal of the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), a passive ion channel that operates in reverse and causes heart muscle death through calcium imbalances. With collaborators at the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient&#xED;ficas in Madrid, Spain and the Universitari Vall d&apos;Hebron - Institut de Recerca in Barcelona, Spain, we are creating NCX inhibitors that can be activated and deactivated when illuminated by different wavelengths of light. Using flexible optic fibers, optical focusing systems, and efficient LED-based electronics, we can modulate the NCX-inhibitor alongside the balloon catheter, improving reperfusion outcomes by minimizing heart muscle death.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Recording Neuron Activity using Implantable Fluorescence Sensors]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Neurostimulation is an effective way to modulate the nervous system to treat diseases and disorders like drug-resistant epilepsy, depression, and Parkinson&#x2019;s.

Stimulation acts by creating a local electric field with an electrode outside of an axon, inducing changes in voltage-gated ion channels that create an action potential (AP). For stimulation to be effective, the strength of the created electric field creates a Goldilocks problem &#x2013; too small of an amplitude fails to activate the axon(s) in question and too large of an amplitude activates undesired axons that can signal the wrong direction or stimulate unintended organs and muscles. Electrical recordings or muscle twitches are used to find stimulation thresholds (by ramping up stimulation amplitude until AP is seen) but recording electrodes must be placed far from stimulation electrodes to avoid stimulation artifact, increasing the implant footprint (larger devices block more blood flow, creating necrotic tissue and eliciting more inflammatory response). We are working on a system that records action potentials chemically by measuring neurotransmitter and ion concentrations at synapses of interest. Using fluorophore-embedded waveguides and implantable miniaturized optics and electronics, we are working to improve the Bionode to both stimulate and record neurons simultaneously.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Next Generation Neuromodulation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Electrical stimulation of nerves, or neuromodulation, is the state-of-the-art treatment for several diseases which cannot be treated through traditional pharmacological interventions such as Parkinson&#x2019;s disease or refractory epilepsy.

This is sufficient when the features of the desired output are known, but when they are not, the designer must make assumptions. Therefore, the resulting data might not contain all the necessary information needed to characterize the signal of interest. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to learn from large, complex datasets, identify hidden features, and make advantageous decisions in ways that meet or exceed human ability; but they are only as good as the data from which they learn, potentially limiting performance. <strong>What if analog filtering circuits were co-designed with ML feedback to create an entirely new learning signal acquisition hardware?</strong> </p><p>Reinforcement &#xA0;learning &#xA0;(RL), &#xA0;one &#xA0;of &#xA0;the &#xA0;three paradigms of ML, is based on rewarding a computational agent for desired behaviors as it explores an interactive environment, learning through trial-and-error by using feedback &#xA0;from &#xA0;its &#xA0;own &#xA0;actions &#xA0;and &#xA0;experiences &#xA0;to optimize a cumulative reward. <strong>We propose the creation of an RL algorithm that derives states and rewards from the &#xA0;validation &#xA0;outputs &#xA0;of &#xA0;a &#xA0;classification-based supervised &#xA0;learning &#xA0;(SL) &#xA0;algorithm, &#xA0;another &#xA0;ML paradigm. </strong> The &#xA0;RL &#xA0;algorithm &#xA0;acts &#xA0;on &#xA0;tunable analog filtering hardware that filters the data from which the SL algorithm learns. This dual optimization will enable the isolation of key characteristics for the signal &#xA0;of &#xA0;interest &#xA0;with &#xA0;hardware &#xA0;filtering &#xA0;whilst simultaneously &#xA0;improving &#xA0;the &#xA0;performance of &#xA0;the &#xA0;SL algorithm.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Deep Learning in Epilepsy]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Epilepsy is a disease involving the spontaneous occurrence of seizure events, which can be dangerous when they occur and are also debilitating to patients&apos; daily lives due to their unpredictability.

Developing methods to monitor and study this disease is difficult and time consuming as patients often must be studied individually due the highly variable physiology. The emerging field of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based algorithms presents a unique opportunity in this space to develop personalized algorithms tuned to each specific patient after initial recording of some representative data. Here at CID we are working to integrate existing ML and DL techniques with our devices and custom datasets to develop algorithms which can analyze, detect, and predict seizure events in real time with never-before-seen accuracy. We are also working to develop new DL techniques that are optimized for time-series biological data and the types of signals that are often collected in biomedical contexts. All of the code and resources we develop to pursue this goal will be made freely available upon publication to other researchers and companies to aid in the development and deployment of highly successful algorithms for epilepsy patients and others in need of sophisticated personalized signal analysis.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Bionode]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Bionode originated between 2012 - 2013.

The early devices up to the Bionode 3.2 were small enough to implant in mice. All devices worked towards the same goal: creating the best device for bioelectric signal recording and stimulation in vivo utilizing wireless powering. This brief history will detail the key innovations that have taken place over the last 10 years of Bionode development.</p><p>The first device, which was never fully standardized, was called the MioNode. It was small enough to implant in mice, recorded EMG signals (hence the name), and did not have a battery so it fully relied on wireless powering. The first standardized Bionode devices were the Bionode 2.0/2.1/2.2 in 2013 - 2014. There was a lot of innovation during this time so most of the details were not recorded. From a discovered Bionode 2 PCB, we found that this particular version has a chip antenna, nRF51822 BGA microcontroller, 2 recording channels similar to the topology used today, and stimulation capabilities. The stimulator had a 12-bit DAC, and there are a few rail-to-rail op amps and switches as well that most likely created a multiplexed stimulator as described for the Bionode 3.0. The board shown in Figure 1 was 20-by-6.5 mm including the removable programming header.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2023/01/image-4.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Bionode" loading="lazy" width="1243" height="441" srcset="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-4.png 600w, https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/image-4.png 1000w, https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2023/01/image-4.png 1243w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 1.

These devices were 2-board systems with a nRF51822 microcontroller, 2 AFE channels, a temperature sensor, 2 coils for wireless powering, and a straight printed communication antenna. The key features of these devices were the stimulators. The Bionode 3.0 used a DAC to set the voltage and then a switch to gate the output, creating square pulses. The two output electrodes were then multiplexed between the DAC output and ground to make one electrode appear positive and create a biphasic output. The Bionode 3.2 had a similar setup where a DAC set the voltage and a switch gated the output to create square pulses, but the output was amplified by a class AB output amplifier made of discrete transistors. With this, the electrodes did not have to be multiplexed as there was a true push-pull biphasic signal.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2023/01/image-5.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Bionode" loading="lazy" width="1553" height="318" srcset="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-5.png 600w, https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/image-5.png 1000w, https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2023/01/image-5.png 1553w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 2.

A 340 MHz sine wave was used to charge a battery through two coils located on the power board. The device was typically packaged in a glass tube or 3D printed tube and implanted in a rat that lived in a 340 MHz resonant cavity. The stimulator utilized a 12-bit DAC7551, stim glitch switch, and Howland current pump (HCP) to create a biphasic current pulse that generates a push-pull biphasic stimulation. There was also a simple impedance measurement circuit to verifying the stimulation current and voltage, but it did not work very well. The stimulation function on the 4.0 board was discovered to be constantly stimulating the animal, so the stim glitch switch was added to the 4.1.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2023/01/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Bionode" loading="lazy" width="1574" height="249" srcset="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-6.png 600w, https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/image-6.png 1000w, https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2023/01/image-6.png 1574w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 3.

This device had a working stimulator and a more sophisticated impedance measurement system so the Bionode Dataview UI could display the correct current and voltage pulse amplitudes. It was and still is the largest Bionode version. One of the issues with this device was that the wireless powering coupled onto the recording channels when the cavity was charging the battery.

Binode 5.0</figcaption></figure><p>The Bionode 5.2 (2019) went back to the 2-board system and that sought to fix the wireless powering problem and be implantable in a planar, flexible packaging. The mainboard houses 95% of the device&#x2019;s components while the powernode is only needed for wireless powering. This device had the same components as the Bionode 5.1 except for a new digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and a quarter-wavelength whip antenna instead of a printed antenna. There is also only one coil for wireless powering which would be located at the spine of a rat when implanted. The wireless powering frequency was changed to 13.56 MHz because it is less likely to couple onto small traces unlike the 340MHz signal. This device worked well except the discontinued footprint was used for the power management IC (PMIC), making a redesign necessary. This board could be wrapped in copper tape to prevent any movement artifact during wireless powering.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2023/01/image-8.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Bionode" loading="lazy" width="576" height="416"><figcaption>Figure 5. Bionode 5.2</figcaption></figure><p>The Bionode 5.3 (2020) is a similar 2-board system to the 5.2, but the biggest change was the addition of 2 micro-SD style chips to facilitate the boards use in wearable use cases and the updated PMIC package. This device also allows access to 2 additional analog channels and 8 GPIO channels on the microcontroller. The battery voltage can be evaluated through Dataview. This design combined two separate level shifter components into one component and used smaller footprints for two other switches. Some of the current problems with this board is that there is not an isolated voltage source for the AFE (a problem that also would have occurring on the Bionode 5.2). Because of this, there is a stimulation artifact on the recording channels during stimulation. This can be fixed by adding an isolated 0.9V reference that only powers the AFE.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2023/01/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Bionode" loading="lazy" width="1219" height="542" srcset="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-9.png 600w, https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/image-9.png 1000w, https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2023/01/image-9.png 1219w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 6.

This board houses the microcontroller, stimulator circuit, impedance measurement circuit, voltage sources and converters, battery charging circuitry, analog front end (AFE), and quarterwavelength whip communication antenna. The rectifying circuity, matching network, and powering coil are located on the Powernode. Through the Base Station, the user can give commands to the Bionode and receive recorded data from it. Figure 7 describes how all these units work together at a system level.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2023/01/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Bionode" loading="lazy" width="1631" height="1040" srcset="https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image.png 600w, https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/image.png 1000w, https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/size/w1600/2023/01/image.png 1600w, https://cid.wse.jhu.edu/content/images/2023/01/image.png 1631w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 7.&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><h3 id="bionode-60">Bionode 6.0</h3><p>To this day development continues with the Bionode 6.0. </p><div class="kg-card kg-header-card kg-width-full kg-size-small kg-style-dark" style data-kg-background-image><h2 class="kg-header-card-header" id="specifications">Specifications</h2><h3 class="kg-header-card-subheader" id="the-bionode-55-characteristics">The Bionode 5.5 Characteristics</h3></div><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="features">Features</h3>
